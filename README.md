This is just for practice and showcasing my Python programming.  If you are attempting the problems on your own and are looking at this git repo for answers, avoid doing so as this would ruin the knowledge you gain from attempting them yourself.  Instead, discuss it on their chat forum @ https://projecteuler.chat/
